# Beam Deflection Calculator

MATLAB script that calculates and plots shear force, bending moment, and deflection for three structural beam configurations.

## Preview
![Output](preview.png)

## Cases analyzed
- Simply supported beam with central point load
- Simply supported beam with uniform distributed load
- Cantilever beam with point load at free end

## Outputs
- Shear force diagram
- Bending moment diagram
- Deflection curve (mm)
- Max deflection and moment printed to command window

## Theory
Based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.

| Case | Max Deflection Formula |
|------|----------------------|
| Simply supported + point load | δ = PL³/48EI |
| Simply supported + distributed load | δ = 5wL⁴/384EI |
| Cantilever + point load | δ = PL³/3EI |

## How to run
```matlab
% Set your beam properties at the top of the script
L = 5;      % length (m)
P = 10000;  % point load (N)
w = 2000;   % distributed load (N/m)
E = 200e9;  % Young's modulus (Pa)
% Then run beam_deflection.m
```
